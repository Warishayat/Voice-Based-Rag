# Voice-Based-Rag
This project is a Voice-Driven Multi-Modal RAG system that allows users to interact with an intelligent agent using spoken input instead of typed text. It combines real-time speech recognition, retrieval-augmented generation, and text-to-speech synthesis to enable a fully voice-based conversational experience with powerful LLMs.
